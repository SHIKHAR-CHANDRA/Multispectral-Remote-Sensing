**Mulitspectral Remote Sensing**

This project aims to calculate two vegetation indices from NAIP and Landsat Remote Sensing data.

The first index is Normalized Difference Vegetation Index or NDVI.
NDVI is a measure of the difference between Near Infrared Light(reflected by vegetation) and Red Light(absorbed by vegetation). NDVI ranges from -1 to +1. Therefore, region of land having NDVI values close to +1 indicate dense vegetation, whereas values close to -1 highly indicate presence of water. 

The second index is Difference Normalized Burn Ratio or dNBR.
